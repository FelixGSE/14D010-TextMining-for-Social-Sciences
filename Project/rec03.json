the kitchen\nBringin' home men at different hours of the night\nStartin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight\n\nSneakin' in her room when her momma's knocked out\nTryin' to have his way and little Lisa says ouch\nShe tries to resist but then all he does is beat her\nTries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her\n\nLisa's stuck up in a world on her own\nForced to think that Hell is a place called home\nNothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack\nShe says she's 'bout to run away and never come back\n\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\n\nLittle Nicole is only ten years old\nShe's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold\nWhy she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her\nAlcoholic Step-dad always wanna strike her\n\nYells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises\nTeachers ask questions, she's makin' up excuses\nBleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out\nIt's only one girl really knows what she's about\n\nHer name is little Stacy and they become friends\nPromise that they'll always be tight 'til the end\nUntil one day, lil' Stacy gets shot\nA drive-by bullet went stray up on her block\n\nNow Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own\nForced to think that Hell is a place called home\nNothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack\nShe says she's 'bout to run away and never come back\n\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\n\nLittle Erica is eleven years old\nShe's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold\nSo she pops *** to get rid of all the pain\nPlus she's havin' sex with her boy who's sixteen\n\nEmotions run deep as she thinks she's in love\nSo there's no protection, he's usin' no glove\nNever thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions\nLivin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction\n\nThe days go by and her belly gets big\nThe father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid\nKnowin' her momma would blow it all out of proportion\nPlus she lives poor, so no money for abortion\n\nErica is stuck up in a world on her own\nForced to think that Hell is a place called home\nNothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack\nShe says she 'bout to run away and never come back\n\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\n\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\nRunaway love, runaway love\n\nRunaway, runaway love\nDon't keep runnin' away\nI'll run away with you\nIf you want me to\n\nYeah, I can only imagine what you goin' through, ladies\nSometimes I feel like runnin' away myself\nSo do me a favor right now and close your eyes\nAnd picture us runnin' away together\nWhen we come back, everythin' is gonna be okay\nOpen your eyes"
