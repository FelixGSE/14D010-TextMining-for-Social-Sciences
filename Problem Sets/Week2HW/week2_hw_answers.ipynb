    "The LSA gives much greater variance in correlations across speeches and much stronger correlations in some speech groupings. This correlation is weakly suggestive of political party and more suggesting of era.\n",
    "\n",
    "We draw the following 2 conclusions based on review of this heatmap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The first five presidents talked about very similar things, irregardless of party affiliation.** There is strong and obvious clustering in speeches 0-40. These are the speeches of the first 5 presidents: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Monroe and Madison. They are from 3 different political parties but demonstrated very similar state of the union speeches. The 41st speech is from Johnson, who was the 17th president, so a different era and political party. In general, the groupings by political party are not as strong as the grouping of these first 5 presidents and correlation within a single president's state of the union speeches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The 2 contemporary parties (Democrats and Republicans) show weak intra-group clustering and stronger time-period clustering.** Speeches 58 - 159 were made by Republicans and 164 - 235 were made by Democrats. You can clearly see the seperation of these groups and note a clustering of Repupblicans' speeches ~120 - ~150, suggesting again dependence on era. In fact, you see this cluster is also highly correlated with a cluster of Democrats, suggesting this dependence on era drives similarity more than party affiliation.\n"
